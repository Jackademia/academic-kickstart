                This project takes five of Edgar Allan Poe's most popular poems that address smilar themes
                of death and loss.

<!-- The Haunted Place by Edgar Allan Poe -->

    <p hidden  id= poem1 > In the greenest of our valleys<br>
        By good angels tenanted,<br>
        Once a fair and stately palace— <br>
        Radiant palace—reared its head. <br>
        In the monarch Thought’s dominion, <br>
        It stood there! <br>
        Never seraph spread a pinion <br>
        Over fabric half so fair!<br>
        
        Banners yellow, glorious, golden,<br>
        On its roof did float and flow<br>
        (This—all this—was in the olden<br>
        Time long ago)<br>
        And every gentle air that dallied,<br>
        In that sweet day,<br>
        Along the ramparts plumed and pallid,<br>
        A wingèd odor went away.<br>
        
        Wanderers in that happy valley,<br>
        Through two luminous windows, saw<br>
        Spirits moving musically<br>
        To a lute’s well-tunèd law,<br>
        Round about a throne where, sitting,<br>
        Porphyrogene!<br>
        In state his glory well befitting,<br>
        The ruler of the realm was seen.<br>
        
        And all with pearl and ruby glowing<br>
        Was the fair palace door,<br>
        Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing<br>
        And sparkling evermore,<br>
        A troop of Echoes, whose sweet duty<br>
        Was but to sing,<br>
        In voices of surpassing beauty,<br>
        The wit and wisdom of their king.<br>
        
        But evil things, in robes of sorrow,<br>
        Assailed the monarch’s high estate;<br>
        (Ah, let us mourn!—for never morrow<br>
        Shall dawn upon him, desolate!)<br>
        And round about his home the glory<br>
        That blushed and bloomed<br>
        Is but a dim-remembered story<br>
        Of the old time entombed.<br>
        
        And travellers, now, within that valley,<br>
        Through the red-litten windows see<br>
        Vast forms that move fantastically<br>
        To a discordant melody;<br>
        While, like a ghastly rapid river,<br>
        Through the pale door<br>
        A hideous throng rush out forever,<br>
        And laugh—but smile no more.<br>

<!-- The Raven by Edgar Allan Poe -->
<p hidden id = poem2>
    Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, <br>
    Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore— <br>
        While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, <br>
    As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. <br>
    “’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door— <br>
                Only this and nothing more.” <br>
    
        Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December; <br>
    And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. <br>
        Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow<br>
        From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—<br>
    For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—<br>
                Nameless here for evermore.<br>
    
        And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain<br>
    Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;<br>
        So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating<br>
        “’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—<br>
    Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—<br>
                This it is and nothing more.”<br>
    
        Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,<br>
    “Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;<br>
        But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,<br>
        And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,<br>
    That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—<br>
                Darkness there and nothing more.<br>
    
        Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,<br>
    Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;<br>
        But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,<br>
        And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”<br>
    This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—<br>
                Merely this and nothing more.<br>
    
        Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,<br>
    Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.<br>
        “Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;<br>
          Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—<br>
    Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—<br>
                ’Tis the wind and nothing more!”<br>
    
        Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,<br>
    In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;<br>
        Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;<br>
        But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—<br>
    Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—<br>
                Perched, and sat, and nothing more.<br>
    
    Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,<br>
    By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,<br>
    “Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,<br>
    Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—<br>
    Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”<br>
                Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”<br>
    
        Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,<br>
    Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;<br>
        For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being<br>
        Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—<br>
    Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,<br>
                With such name as “Nevermore.”<br>
    
        But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only<br>
    That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.<br>
        Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—<br>
        Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—<br>
    On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”<br>
                Then the bird said “Nevermore.”<br>
    
        Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,<br>
    “Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store<br>
        Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster<br>
        Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—<br>
    Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore<br>
                Of ‘Never—nevermore’.”<br>
    
        But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,<br>
    Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;<br>
        Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking<br>
        Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—<br>
    What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore<br>
                Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”<br>
    
        This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing<br>
    To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;<br>
        This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining<br>
        On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,<br>
    But whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,<br>
                She shall press, ah, nevermore!<br>
    
        Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer<br>
    Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.<br>
        “Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee<br>
        Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;<br>
    Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”<br>
                Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”<br>
    
        “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—<br>
    Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,<br>
        Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—<br>
        On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—<br>
    Is there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”<br>
                Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”<br>
    
        “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!<br>
    By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—<br>
        Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,<br>
        It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—<br>
    Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”<br>
                Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”<br>
    
        “Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—<br>
    “Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!<br>
        Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!<br>
        Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!<br>
    Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”<br>
                Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”<br>
    
        And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting<br>
    On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;<br>
        And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,<br>
        And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;<br>
    And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor<br>
                Shall be lifted—nevermore!<br>
</p>


<!-- Annabel Lee by Edgar Allan Poe-->
<p hidden id = poem3>
    It was many and many a year ago,<br>
   In a kingdom by the sea,<br>
That a maiden there lived whom you may know<br>
   By the name of Annabel Lee;<br>
And this maiden she lived with no other thought<br>
   Than to love and be loved by me.<br>

I was a child and she was a child,<br>
   In this kingdom by the sea,<br>
But we loved with a love that was more than love—<br>
   I and my Annabel Lee—<br>
With a love that the wingèd seraphs of Heaven<br>
   Coveted her and me.<br>

And this was the reason that, long ago,<br>
   In this kingdom by the sea,<br>
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling<br>
   My beautiful Annabel Lee;<br>
So that her highborn kinsmen came<br>
   And bore her away from me,<br>
To shut her up in a sepulchre<br>
   In this kingdom by the sea.<br>

The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,<br>
   Went envying her and me—<br>
Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know,<br>
   In this kingdom by the sea)<br>
That the wind came out of the cloud by night,<br>
   Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.<br>

But our love it was stronger by far than the love<br>
   Of those who were older than we—<br>
   Of many far wiser than we—<br>
And neither the angels in Heaven above<br>
   Nor the demons down under the sea<br>
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul<br>
   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;<br>

For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams<br>
   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;<br>
And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes<br>
   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;<br>
And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side<br>
   Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride,<br>
   In her sepulchre there by the sea—<br>
   In her tomb by the sounding sea.<br>

</p>

<!-- A Dream by Edgar Allan Poe-->
<p hidden id = poem4>
    In visions of the dark night<br>
I have dreamed of joy departed—<br>
But a waking dream of life and light<br>
Hath left me broken-hearted.<br>

Ah! what is not a dream by day<br>
To him whose eyes are cast<br>
On things around him with a ray<br>
Turned back upon the past?<br>

That holy dream—that holy dream,<br>
While all the world were chiding,<br>
Hath cheered me as a lovely beam<br>
A lonely spirit guiding.<br>

What though that light, thro' storm and night,<br>
So trembled from afar—<br>
What could there be more purely bright<br>
In Truth's day-star?<br>
</p>
<!-- A Dream Within a Dream by Edgar Allan Poe-->

<p hidden id = poem5>
    Take this kiss upon the brow!<br>
And, in parting from you now,<br>
Thus much let me avow —<br>
You are not wrong, who deem<br>
That my days have been a dream;<br>
Yet if hope has flown away<br>
In a night, or in a day,<br>
In a vision, or in none,<br>
Is it therefore the less gone? <br>
All that we see or seem<br>
Is but a dream within a dream.<br>

I stand amid the roar<br>
Of a surf-tormented shore,<br>
And I hold within my hand<br>
Grains of the golden sand —<br>
How few! yet how they creep<br>
Through my fingers to the deep,<br>
While I weep — while I weep!<br>
O God! Can I not grasp<br>
Them with a tighter clasp?<br>
O God! can I not save<br>
One from the pitiless wave?<br>
Is all that we see or seem<br>
But a dream within a dream?<br>
</p>
